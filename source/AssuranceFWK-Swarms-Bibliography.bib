	abstract = {Ethics is inherently a multiagent concern. However, research on AI ethics today is dominated by work on individual agents: (1) how an autonomous robot or car may harm or (differentially) benefit people in hypothetical situations (the so-called trolley problems) and (2) how a machine learning algorithm may produce biased decisions or recommendations. The societal framework is largely omitted.To develop new foundations for ethics in AI, we adopt a sociotechnical stance in which agents (as technical entities) help autonomous social entities or principals (people and organizations). This multiagent conception of a sociotechnical system (STS) captures how ethical concerns arise in the mutual interactions of multiple stakeholders. These foundations would enable us to realize ethical STSs that incorporate social and technical controls to respect stated ethical postures of the agents in the STSs. The envisioned foundations require new thinking, along two broad themes, on how to realize (1) an STS that reflects its stakeholders' values and (2) individual agents that function effectively in such an STS.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has evolved into an enabling technology for a wide range of highly successful applications. The potential for this success to continue and accelerate has placed machine learning (ML) at the top of research, economic, and political agendas. Such unprecedented interest is fuelled by a vision of ML applicability extending to healthcare, transportation, defence, and other domains of great societal importance. Achieving this vision requires the use of ML in safety-critical applications that demand levels of assurance beyond those needed for current ML applications. Our article provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in the assurance of ML, i.e., in the generation of evidence that ML is sufficiently safe for its intended use. The survey covers the methods capable of providing such evidence at different stages of the machine learning lifecycle, i.e., of the complex, iterative process that starts with the collection of the data used to train an ML component for a system, and ends with the deployment of that component within the system. The article begins with a systematic presentation of the ML lifecycle and its stages. We then define assurance desiderata for each stage, review existing methods that contribute to achieving these desiderata, and identify open challenges that require further research.},

	abstract = {Many-robot systems are becoming a reality for large companies that can invest in bespoke solutions. These systems often require carefully engineered infrastructure and a central planner to coordinate the robots. Outside these controlled environments, robots typically generate a shared situational awareness of the world and state of their task. This requires sophisticated mapping, perception, and control, with changes to the environment or tasks causing challenges to robot deployment. The assumption that centralized situational awareness is needed to deal with real-world complexity may be holding back the field from deploying many-robot systems. Yet potential applications are wide-ranging, including environmental monitoring, construction, agriculture, and logistics. Mainstream adoption requires usability out-of-the-box, in unstructured environments, at a reasonable cost. Distributed situational awareness is proposed as a method to design many-robot systems differently. Distributed situational awareness allows swarms of low-cost robots to rapidly and accurately capture the state of an environment and act accordingly, with no central data storage, modeling, or control. Its distributed nature enhances resilience and redundancy while reducing reliance on infrastructure and central planners. Deploying distributed situational awareness however requires new tools to design hardware and algorithms, demonstrate that it works and is safe, and is intuitive for users of the swarm.},

@article{Hoffmann2016,
   abstract = {Formal verification of agents representing robot behaviour is a growing area due to the demand that autonomous systems have to be proven safe. In this paper we present an abstract definition of autonomy which can be used to model autonomous scenarios and propose the use of small-scale simulation models representing abstract actions to infer quantitative data. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach we build and verify a model of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an exemplary autonomous scenario, utilising this approach.},

@article{Calinescu2018,
   abstract = {We describe a tool-supported method for the efficient synthesis of parametric continuous-time Markov chains (pCTMC) that correspond to robust designs of a system under development. The pCTMCs generated by our RObust DEsign Synthesis (RODES) method are resilient to changes in the system's operational profile, satisfy strict reliability, performance and other quality constraints, and are Pareto-optimal or nearly Pareto-optimal with respect to a set of quality optimisation criteria. By integrating sensitivity analysis at designer-specified tolerance levels and Pareto optimality, RODES produces designs that are potentially slightly suboptimal in return for less sensitivity—an acceptable trade-off in engineering practice. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the efficiency of its GPU-accelerated tool support across multiple application domains by using RODES to design a producer-consumer system, a replicated file system and a workstation cluster system.},
