\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
The main contribution of this paper is a novel framework for assurance of emergent behaviour for use in autonomous robotic swarms based on the AMLAS, SACE* and SOCA* guidance (* under consideration). We illustrate the framework using a public cloakroom case study.

\section{Background and Related Work}\label{background-relatedwork}

\subsection{Background}\label{background}

\subsubsection{Specification Challenges and Standards}
%\newline With respect to swarms, the overall behaviours of a swarm are not explicitly engineered in the system, but they are an emergent consequence of the interaction of individual agents with each other and the environment.
%This emergent functionality poses a challenge for specification. 
%\newline How do you ensure safety or any other extra-functional property of a swarm where the swarm’s behaviour is an “emergent” consequence of the interaction of individual agents with each other and their environment?
%Swarm behaviours:
%\newline Aggregation 
%\newline Coherent ad-hoc network
%\newline Information retrieval
%\newline Taxis towards pick up and delivery areas of boxes
%\newline Obstacle avoidance
%\newline Object organization
%
%\textit{IEEE P7001} standard describes measurable, testable levels of transparency for autonomous systems so that they can be objectively assessed and levels of compliance determined\cite{IEEE-P7001}. 
%This standard outlines five stakeholder groups, and for each group it explains the structure of the normative definitions of levels of transparency. 
%\textit{IEEE P7001} can be applied to assess the transparency of an existing system using a process of System Transparency Assessment, or to specify transparency requirements for a system prior to its implementation (System Transparency Specification).
%The 5 stakeholders are end users, general public and bystanders, safety certification agencies and auditors, incident/accident investigators, expert advisors.
%
%In service robotics, ISO 13482 covers the hazards presented by the robots and devices for applications in non-industrial environments for providing services. 
%ISO 23482-1 and ISO 23482-2 standards extend ISO 13482 with guidance and methods that can be used to test personal care robots.
%On the other hand, in the industrial sector, ISO 10218-1 and ISO 10218-2 provide safety requirements for industrial robots and their integration.
%Meanwhile, ISO/TS 15066 provides safety requirements for collaborative industrial robot systems and work environment. 
%Although these industry standards focus on ensuring safety of robots at the individual robot level, they do not ensure safety or any other extra-functional property at the swarm level, which is a limitation.
%
%This Figure shows a categorization of robots by ISO. 
%Identifying which robot category the individual robots of the cloakroom is important because different legal and regulatory requirements apply to different robot categories.
%The “service robot” contains most robot categories, except industrial robot. 
%These are: household robots, medical robots and personal care robots.
%The individual robots of the cloakroom better fit into the “mobile servant robots” category, which is a type of personal care robot under service robots.
%A mobile servant robot is a personal care robot capable of travelling to perform serving tasks in interaction with humans, e.g. handling objects or exchanging information [ISO 13482:2014, 3.14].

\subsubsection{Case Study}

\noindent\textbf{\textit{\newline[Author Guidelines: Please use the cloakroom case study to illustrate the framework in Section III. If the examples in cloakroom case study are not sufficient, other swarm use cases listed below can be considered.]}}

\paragraph{\textbf{Cloakroom}\label{ex:cloakroom}}
The case study describes a public cloakroom where swarm of robots assist customers looking to deposit their jackets at an event \cite{Jones2020}. 
It describes cases where customers are depositing jackets, handing a jacket to a robot for storing, and retrieval of jackets back to the customer. 

\paragraph{Other Swarm Use Cases}
\textbf{\\Fault detection, diagnosis and recovery – Monitoring fires in a natural environment}. Fault detection model shall be trained to high level of accuracy. Thresholds for fault tolerance shall be set appropriately such that misclassification of a fault is a rare event. An agent experiencing minor faults shall not be immediately removed, should the fault not impact the task at hand. \\
\textbf{\noindent Social swarm – Brainstorming at an event}. Humans follow robots which cluster based on input. Minimise blocking paths of other humans and agents. Maintain situational awareness of humans and agents in the environment. Before the task, provide a clear explanation of the steps of the activity. Clear guidance during the task. Provide information about how the swarm/robot works.

\subsubsection{Assurance of Machine Learning in Autonomous Systems (AMLAS)}
%\cite{Hawkins2021}
\textit{Assurance of Machine Learning for use in Autonomous Systems (AMLAS)} provides guidance on how to systematically integrate safety assurance into the development of machine learning components based on offline supervised learning \cite{AMLAS2021}. 
AMLAS provides an explicit and structured safety case that the system is safe to operate in its intended context of use. 
AMLAS contains six stages, and the assurance activities are performed in parallel to the development of machine learning component. 
The process is iterative by design and feedback is used to update previous stages.

%Simple algorithms are executed by individuals.
%These simple behaviours performed by large numbers of agents build to emergent behaviours.
%The adaptivity provided by emergence requires assurance.

%Scope of current study:
%Looking purely at inherent swarm qualities and the adaptation that stems from these.
%Developing individual behaviours which when combined create an adaptive emergence.
%Machine/Reinforcement Learning should not be considered at this time.

\subsection{Stage 1: EB Safety Assurance Scoping} \label{framework-stage1}
In this study, we look at inherent swarm qualities and the adaptation that arise from these qualities. 
In a swarm, individual robots execute simple behaviours or algorithms, and these simple behaviours when performed by a large number of agents build to form \emph{emergent behaviours} (EB). 
%These simple behaviours performed by large numbers of agents build to emergent behaviours.
%For this, we will look into developing individual behaviours which when combined create an adaptive emergence. 
The adaptivity provided by this emergence requires us to provide for \textit{assurance} in safety. 
At present, our study does not consider AMLAS adaptation to individual robots using machine learning, which we will consider as part of future work once AMLAS has been applied to the swarm.
%However, we may consider this later once AMLAS has been applied to the swarm.

The adapted Stage 1 contains two activities which are performed to define the safety assurance scope for the swarm (see Fig.~\ref{amlas-a-stage1}).  
As part of activity 2, the artefacts generated from Stage 1 are used to instantiate the EB safety assurance scoping argument pattern. \\

\noindent \textbf{Activity 1: Define the safety assurance scope for the EB description and expected output}

The required inputs to Stage 1 are the system safety requirements ([A]), the operating environment [B],  the system description [C], and a description of the EB and expected output ([D]). 
Inputs A, B, C and D will be used to determine the safety requirements which are allocated to the swarm. 
The requirements defined in Stage 1 are independent of any EB technique or metric.
Instead, these requirements reflect the need for the swarm to perform safely with the system regardless of the deployed technology. 
The output of this activity is the safety requirements that are allocated to the swarm [E]. 
\begin{figure}[!t]

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/amlas-a-stage1-v2.png}
	\caption{Stage 1: Adapted AMLAS emergent behaviour assurance scoping process.}
	\label{amlas-a-stage1}
\end{figure}
\\

\noindent \textbf{Artefact A -- System safety requirements: }
The system safety assessment process generates the safety requirements of the swarm, which covers identification of hazards and performing of a risk analysis. 
As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{failure-events}, this can be shown in the form of concrete failure conditions that the output of an individual robot or a robot in the neighbourhood makes to potential swarm-level hazards. 
Although this has been illustrated as a simplified linear chain of events, in reality this can contain more complex chain of events. 

With respect to hazard identification and risk analysis performed in our study, in the \textit{cloakroom} use case, a key hazard is the blocking of critical paths. 
This can result in humans or other agents in the swarm unable to travel to urgent locations in a safe manner. 
In the \textit{monitoring fires in a natural environment} use case, a key hazard is critical faults not being detected correctly. This can result in swarm operating with critically faulty agents where unsafe behaviours may emerge. Another hazard is when faults can be misdiagnosed, for example, a minor fault can be diagnosed as a critical fault (e.g. a minor reduction of the wheel speed labelled as full motor failure). This can result in key agents being removed from the swarm and it not being able to perform its tasks effectively.\\ 
\begin{figure}[!t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/stage1-failureevents.png}
	\caption{Failure conditions in a swarm [adapted from DO-178C, AMLAS].}
	\label{failure-events}
\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{Artefact B -- Environment description: }
As in AMLAS guidance, when allocating safety requirements to the swarm, it is essential to consider the system environment, which is represented by Artefact B. 
Based on the different use cases considered in our study, we can provide a description of their environments as follows.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{A swarm of robotic agents collecting and delivering jackets, stored in small box-like containers within a cloakroom}. Agents are required to navigate a public space between collection and delivery points of jackets. Agents use local communication, perception, and data to form an emergent system of navigation that allows them to easily traverse the public space between their jacket collection and delivery points.
	\item \textit{A swarm of UAVs monitoring wildfire risks in a natural environment}. Here, agents will be required to stay within communication range of each other, effectively covering the search area and accurately detecting risks of fire.
	\item \textit{Social swarm – brainstorming at an event}. Humans input their opinions on agents which then cluster based on the input. [Humans follow the agent they interacted with and user groups emerge in the process.]\\
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Artefact C -- System description: }
In the architecture, \textit{sensors} available to agents can be: cameras (multiple), Bluetooth communication devices, and light detection and ranging systems (see Fig.~\ref{system-description}). 
At the neighbourhood level, we can consider a Bluetooth system to ensure data available to agents are within a communication distance (e.g. 5m). 
Thus, it can result in several neighbourhood data, such as: the approximate position, current status, picking and dropping of correct boxes and deployed time. 
As for swarm parameters to ensure the overall swarm qualities, we can consider: the number of agents, the maximum speed of an agent, and the number of agents allowed to be active at a time. 
Once we have these three inputs, i.e. agent sensors, neighbourhood data and swan parameters, they are fed into the agent behaviour itself.
The agent behaviour is then multiplied by the number of agents that is in the swarm. 
Then emergent behaviour can be produced by way of the social interaction that occurs between the agents.\\

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{figures/stage1-systema.png}
	\caption{System description.}
	\label{system-description}
\end{figure}

\noindent \textbf{Artefact D -- EB description and expected output: }
%This artefact describes the role and scope of the component within the system of which it is part, and the interfaces to which it is exposed.
By expected output here we mean the gains (output) that can arise from multiple agents.
%Let us consider the type and configuration of the emergent behaviour. 
The output is a collaborative system capable of collecting, sorting and redelivering jackets in a public setting. 
With respect to constraints, the emergent behaviour of the system needs to be manually engineered by a swarm engineer through the use of behavior trees and available sub-behaviours within an agent.\\
%

\noindent \textbf{Activity 2: Instantiate the EB assurance scoping argument pattern}

\noindent \textbf{Artefact F -- EB Safety assurance scoping argument pattern: }
The argument pattern relating to this stage is shown in Fig.~\ref{stage1-ap}.

\ Sociotechnical Requirements Analysis for Autonomous Robotic Swarms

The focus of much work to date on the design of autonomous systems and specification techniques to assure safety in these systems has primarily been on developing technical aspects of assurance \cite{brundage2020toward}. However, despite significant investments and efforts, getting technical safety assurance right has proved to be a challenging task (see, for instance, Karvonen et al., 2020; Thieme et al., 2021; Hernandez et al., 2021). The causes for problems are complex and varied and remain poorly understood. Simplistic claims that technical assurance will reduce risk to technological performance ignores the inherently sociotechnical nature of autonomous and intelligent systems: the fact that “all technologies are designed, developed, built, deployed, maintained, supervised, operated, and governed by people; and those people necessarily work within, and are shaped by, complex social, cultural, and organisational processes” makes assurance extremely complex (Macrae, 2021: 3; Pettersen Could, 2021; Reason, 1997).

In the case of designing emergent behaviours data plays a vital role, though one that differs from the machine learning applications AMLAS was initially designed for. In order to address this difference, the following activities and outputs have been adjusted to take into account the swarm behavioural design process and the added complexities that come with multiple agents interacting with one another.

\subsubsection*{Activity 6. Define Data Requirements}

% AMLAS - This activity requires as input the ML safety requirements ([H]) as described in Stage 2 and, from these requirements, data requirements ([L]) shall be generated. Of particular interest in the development of data requirements are those safety requirements which pertain to the description of the system environment.

In our adaptation of activity 6 we take the emergent behaviour safety requirements [H] outlined in Stage 2 as an input. These safety requirements guide the data requirements in this activity, feeding into the data specification that we outline here. Unlike the original AMLAS framework, we have split the data requirement [L] into two multi-agent focused requirements: [L.0] data type requirements and [L.1] data availability constraints.

\paragraph*{[L.0] Data Type Requirements}

This elements focus on the relevance, completeness, accuracy, and balance of the information that will be used to construct the swarm behaviour and will be subsequently used to test the emergent behaviour of the system prior to its deployment.

The relevance of the data used in the development of the emergent behaviour specifies the extent to which the test environment must match the intended operating domain into which the model is to be deployed. Examples of requirements relating to relevance are shown in Table \ref{tab:L0_relevance}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{p{1cm} p{6cm}}
        \textbf{ID} & \textbf{Example} \\
        \hline
        RQ 5.1 & All simulations shall include environments with different ranges of incline between 0-20\textdegree.\\
        \hline
        RQ 5.2 & All simulations shall be conducted in a dry environment.\\
        \hline
        RQ 5.3 & All simulations shall include floors with step increases that are $\leq$ 0.5 cm.\\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Relevance requirement examples for output [L.0].}
    \label{tab:L0_relevance}
\end{table}

The completeness of the data specifies the conditions under which we test the behaviour algorithm i.e. the volume of experiments or tests that will be run, the variety of tests executed, and the diversity of environments expected to be used in the testing process. Requirements examples relating to completeness are shown in Table \ref{tab:L0_completeness}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{p{1cm} p{6cm}}
        \textbf{ID} & \textbf{Example} \\
        \hline
        RQ 6.1 & All simulations shall be repeated to include fault injections representative of full communication faults.\\
        \hline
        RQ 6.2 & All simulations shall be repeated a sufficient number of times to ensure results are representative of typical use.\\
        \hline
        RQ 6.3 & All simulations shall be repeated in multiple environments representative of those expected in real-world use of the system.\\
        \hline
        RQ 6.4 & All simulations shall include sufficient range of robot density levels within the scope of the operational domain.\\ 
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Completeness requirement examples for output [L.0].}
    \label{tab:L0_completeness}
\end{table}

Accuracy in this context relates to the parameters defining the performance of the swarm systems primary function. For example, what constitutes a delivery in a logistics scenario, or under what conditions would an area be considered explored in a surveying mission. Table \ref{tab:L0_accuracy} shows some data requirement examples relating to accuracy.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{p{1cm} p{6cm}}
        \textbf{ID} & \textbf{Example} \\
        \hline
        RQ 7.1 & All boxes shall only be considered ‘delivered’, if all four of the boxes’ feet are positioned within the delivery zone.\\
        \hline
        RQ 7.2 & All boxes shall only be considered ‘delivered’, once they are no longer in direct contact with a swarm agent.\\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Accuracy requirement examples for output [L.0].}
    \label{tab:L0_accuracy}
\end{table}

Balance, outside of a machine learning use case, refers the balance of the trials executed in the testing process of the emergent behaviour algorithm. By considering balance, we expect the number of tests conducted for individual failure modes or environment types to be justified, ensuring that there is not an unrealistic bias in testing towards a particular scenario. Some examples of data requirements relating to balance are listed in \ref{tab:L0_balance}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{p{1cm} p{6cm}}
        \textbf{ID} & \textbf{Example} \\
        \hline
        RQ 8.1 & All simulations shall be repeated so as to obtain representative evaluations for each possible mode of failure (defined under performance, adaptability and human-safety requirements in Stage 2).\\
        \hline
        RQ 8.2 & All simulations shall be repeated equally across all test environments.\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Balance requirement examples for output [L.0].}
    \label{tab:L0_balance}
\end{table}

%In Table \ref{tab:L0} we list each of the requirement focuses considered in this output and provide respective examples of swarm data requirements.

\paragraph*{[L.1] Data Availability Constraints}

With the introduction of multiple agents comes the issue of data availability. Distributed communication is a key feature found in emergent systems. As such, it is crucial to define how much information each agent is expected to hold, how easily data may transfer between agents, and across what range agents should be able to transfer information between one another. We present a list of feasible constrains with representative examples in Table \ref{tab:constraints}.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{p{2cm} p{6cm}}
         \textbf{Constraint Type} & \textbf{Example}  \\
         \hline
         Storage capacity & The swarm agents shall have a maximum of 2 GB of information stored on board at any point in time. \\
         \hline
         Available sensors & The swarm agents shall only have access to environmental data deemed feasibly collectable by infrared sensors positioned radially every 30 degrees. \\
         \hline
         Communications Range & The swarm agents shall only have access to other agent data when within communications range of 5 meters. \\
         \hline
         Operator feedback & The swarm agents shall only share information with non-agent’s (e.g. operator terminal) when within communications range of 5 meters.
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Swarm data constraints for output [L.1] with representative examples from the cloakroom use case.}
    \label{tab:constraints}
\end{table}

\paragraph*{[M] Data Requirements Justification Report}

This report remains mainly unchanged from the traditional AMLAS framework. This report acts as an assessment of the data requirements, providing analysis and explanation for how the requirements and constraints (outlined in [L.0] and [L.1]) address the emergent behaviour safety requirements specified in [H].

\subsubsection*{Activity 7. Define Swarm Evaluation Requirements}

Taking the outputs [L.0] and [L.1] from the activity 6, the evaluation requirements take into account how the emergent behaviour of the swarm will be assessed, specifying the testing environment and the metrics comprising the test results.  

\paragraph*{[N] Test Environment}

This output takes into consideration the requirements specified in activity 6 and defines the environment in which the emergent behaviour will be tested. In most cases this will be multiple simulation environments featuring diverse sets of terrain, environmental conditions and obstacle configurations. There may also be instances in which this test environment is specified as a physical environment operating under laboratory conditions, with a hardware systems acting as a test bed to observe designed behaviours.

\paragraph*{[O] Swarm Performance Metrics}

The performance metrics specified in this activity are used to quantify how well the system is performing. While there may be multiple performance metrics, these metrics should be defined with respect to the primary function of the swarm system. Metrics that might feature in this output could include: the delivery rate in a logistics scenario, rate of area coverage as well as the efficiency of said coverage in an exploration task, or the response time in a disaster scenario.

\paragraph*{[P] Verification Metric}

These metrics should be derived from the safety requirements [H] specified in Stage 2. These metrics are intended to be used as the criteria for success within the verification process. Examples of these metrics and their related safety requirements might include: Swarm density, used in verifying environmental safety specifications such as RQ 4.1, maximum collision force experienced by agents, which could be used to verify that the swarm meets safety performance requirements such as RQ 1.1 and RQ 1.2, or current speed of all agents, a metric relating directly to the human safety requirements RQ 3.1 and RQ 3.2.

%the swarm density (used to monitor environmental specification), maximum collision force experienced by agents, or the speed of all agents at a given time.

\paragraph*{[Q] Sensing and Metric Assumptions Log}

Much like the data log used within the traditional AMLAS framework, this log serves as a record of the details and decisions made in activities 6 and 7. This log should contain details of the choices made when producing the Test environment [N], Swarm Performance Metrics [M] and the Verification Metric [P].

\subsubsection*{Activity 8. Validate Evaluation Requirements}

Taking into account outputs [N], [O] and [P] from activity 7, this activity aims to validate these components with respect to the requirements specified in activity 6. Should any discrepancies exist between the data requirements and the evaluation requirements, they should be justified appropriately and recorded in output [S] Swarm Evaluation Validation Results.

	\label{amlas-a-stage4}
\end{figure*}

In the design of an emergent behaviour algorithm, the challenge is in selecting behaviours at the individual level of the agent which give rise to the desired emergent behaviour at the swarm level. The original AMLAS application in Stage 4 focused on the creation, testing and instantiation of a machine learning model for a single system with no emergent behaviours to consider for a collective. In our adaptation of AMLAS for the robot swarm,  we step away from the machine learning paradigm to allow consideration for all possible optimization algorithms which may attain the target emergent behaviour.

\subsubsection*{Activity 10. Create EB Algorithm:}

Here we have two levels to consider: the individual level behaviour which is informed by individual agent sensing capabilities [N*] and the swarm level emergent behaviour which shall necessarily meet the safety requirements [H] defined in Stage 2. In the example of the cloakroom given in Section \ref{ex:cloakroom}, the target emergent behaviour for the swarm shall ensure that items are stored and retrieved by individuals. Performance requirements RQ1.1 and RQ1.2 specify an upper bound on the low/high impact collisions that a swarm shall experience in a given time frame. These requirements may be fulfilled by constraining the maximum velocity of individual robots, for example, or by ensuring that a robot has a camera or infra-red sensors which enable it to detect obstacles. The outputs from this activity follow the AMLAS framework, with a candidate emergent behaviour algorithm produced rather than a ML model. Output [U], the model development log, should log the rationale in the design process of the emergent behaviour algorithm.

\subsubsection*{Activity 11. Test EB Algorithm:}

In this activity, the candidate emergent behaviour will be tested against the swarm performance metrics [O] produced in Stage 3. Testing ensures that the emergent behaviour performs as desired with respect to the defined metrics and in the case where performance is above the accepted thresholds, the emergent behaviour algorithm will be produced as an output [V] of the activity. The internal test results [X] will also be an output from the testing process.

% *****************
% GC Contribution, see table for qualities on 'swarm' tab here:
% https://uob.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/grp-TAS_Research2/Shared%20Documents/Verification/presentations/TrustQualities.xlsx?d=w4527b0bf0f4e49ab905d638dcb8c14ff&csf=1&web=1&e=8RW2vb

Inputs to the verification process are the [H] EB Safety Requirements, [P] Verification Scenarios (Test Generation) and [V] EB Algorithm. 
%
The verification method and assessment process within that method will be largely determined by the specifics of the safety requirements and examples from the cloakroom example will be used to illustrate the process. Some safety specifications lend themselves towards certain assessment methods due to the scenarios they prescribe.
%
For example, assessing the swarm system meets the requirements for performance given a motor fault injection [RQ1.6] may be easier to realise in physical or simulation based testing approaches, than constructing a reliable formal model of robot behaviour given the complex physical dynamics of a faulty wheel. 
%
However, when considering the adaptability requirements, a formal, probabilistic-based verification technique of the EB algorithm [V] is more suitable. For example, in [RQ2.1] analysis using a probabilistic finite state machine of the swarm behaviour tree, for example see \cite{Hoffmann2016,Calinescu2018}, could identify the dwell period within certain states. Monitors could be used to observe when agents enter a stationary state, e.g. \texttt{agent\_velocity=0 $\land $  t\_counter  $\ge$ 100}, and identify if time within that state exceeded some fixed value, and ascertain a probabilistic value to this metric.
%
These examples will now be expanded in more detail below.

\subsubsection{Verification Scenario (Test Generation) [P]}

In most cases there will be multiple, valid verification scenarios or tests applicable for each of the safety specifications. A summary of a few examples from [H] EB SafetyRequirements specification and potential verification methods are explored in Table~\ref{tab:testgen}. 

For RQ1.1, relating to low impact collisions, suitable scenarios should consider both simulation and physical testing to observe the safety compliance of the swarm controller. For simulation, where testing time can be accelerated through parallelisation, test generation could include some randomisation and constrained randomisation to look for failures in the collision detection system. Physical testing, usually with tighter time constraints should be more prescriptive with testing and should orchestrate scenarios that have a high probability of exercising the collision detection routine of the swarm controller, for example forcing swarm agents to travel a narrow passage. 

A question then may be which of the methods is more valid, which is an argument that aligns closely to that of test case selection. A good test case \cite{Fewster1999} must be:...

Runtime verification can offer a solution to verifying systems that operate in large state-spaces that may be intractable to verify at design time. However, the choice or design of runtime oracle [ref] which provides the ground truth may require significant development, or innovative solutions [cyres paper]. However, in this swarm case study this may be achieved with collision detection monitors, either implemented within the swarm robots or externally monitored through a tracking system, e.g. Vicon. Tracking with an external systems may be less reliable that physical sensing, e.g. accelerometer based collision detection, but being an independent system offers other assurances, as collisions may instigate cascading failure where the agents fail to report the collision event due to other failures, e.g. network connectivity.

\subsubsection*{Activity 15. Integrate EB}

With the emergent behaviour verified, the next step is to take the model [V] as well as the system safety requirements [V], environment description [B] and system description [C] and integrate the emergent behaviour with the system to be deployed. In this activity we use the inputs to this stage to educate the implementation of the emergent behaviour and anticipate errors we might expect in the interactions between agents and the overall emergent behaviour. Despite the rigorous validation and testing conducted in previous stages, there will still be a gap between the test environment and the intended, every day use, deployed scenario. The output, [DD] Model Development Log, captures these anticipated gaps between testing and reality and the differences in behaviour that might sprout from them.

For example, once physically deployed it may become apparent that large fluctuations in speed used to maintain performance while keeping the system safe for Humans, may in reality be too much of a draw on the agents batteries to get a reasonable lifetime out of each battery charge. To address this the behaviour may need to be tweaked to sacrifice some performance in the short term, reducing the rates of acceleration experienced by agents, in order to gain a longer battery life.

\subsubsection*{Activity 16. Test the Integration}

Once the initial integration is complete the physical implementation should undergo an additional round of testing in which the system will be observed in multiple operational scenarios, as specified in [EE].

\paragraph*{[EE] Operational Scenarios}

These operational scenarios should reflect the environment descriptions specified in [B], offering a real-world situations to examine the behaviour of the integrated system. The testing of the integrated system in these true-to-operation environments should be conducted in a safe manner. Ensuring that the entire multi-agent system can be shut down in an emergency, or providing shadow operators for groups of agents, taking over should the swarm behave erroneously.

In our cloakroom scenario, an example of [EE] may take the form of a small deployment of agents in a real but controlled coat storage area.

% Capture any integration issues

% provide a few environment examples

% Identify Erroneous behaviour expected and outlined in [DD], while simultaniously looking to catch/identify any issues of integration previously overlooked.

\paragraph*{[FF] Integration Testing Results}

Results from the integration testing will be reported here, detailing how the system performs against the safety requirements [H] specified in stage 2.
